The following exercise contains the following subjects:
● Ternaries
● Logical operators
Instructions
Create a simple password validation function that takes a
password string as an argument.
If the length of the password is more than 7 characters return
“Strong”. If it is less than 7 characters long return “Weak.
1. Create a function that uses an if/else conditional
expression.
2. Create a function that uses a ternary conditional
expression.
3. Create a function that uses a && logical operator.
4. Create an “advanced” password validation function that
takes a password string as an argument.
If the password length is more than 7 characters long and
has at least one capital letter return “Very Strong”. If the
password length is only 7 characters long returns “Strong”.
If the password length is less than 7 characters long return
“Weak”
Use only a ternary conditional expression.
